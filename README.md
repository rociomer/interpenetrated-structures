## Instructions
(Note: will need Zeo++ to convert files from CSSR to CIF format)

Copy fileConversion.py and findInterpenetratedStructures.py to
directory with CSSR files for structures to interpenetrate. If necessary,
modify the path to Zeo++ at the top of fileConversion.py. Then modify any 
parameters at the top of findInterpenetratedStructures.py, and run. 
Output files will be written to the working directory.

## Description
This program was written so as to facilitate the generation 
of interpenetrated structures (2-fold and greater) of covalent 
organic frameworks (COFs) and similar nanoporous frameworks.
